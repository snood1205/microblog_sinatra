# Microblog

This is a project to bootstrap a microblog application in Sinatra using the `pg` gem to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
It is eschewing the use of an ORM to be much more lightweight and to allow for me to create my own way of handling migrations and models
different from ActiveRecord.
